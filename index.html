        <p>I enjoy reading fantasy, romance, and the occasional sci-fi or space opera. Video games are more of a reason to play with friends that are long distance than a way of life though the occasional single player game is also entertaining. I love playing Dungeons and Dragons as well as other various TTRPG games. One of my favorite table top characters is depicted as the profile picture.</p>

            <p>Home of the Revolutionary War and Civil War, the USA is a country that may not be the greatest in a lot of things that matter, but it definitely could be.</p>
