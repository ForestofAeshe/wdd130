        <p>I enjoy reading fantasy, romance, and the occasional sci-fi or space opera. Video games are more of a reason to play with friends that are long distance than a way of life though the occasional single player game is also entertaining. I love playing Dungeons and Dragons as well as other various TTRPG games. One of my favorite characters from one such game is depicted in the image above as the profile picture.</p>
